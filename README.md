# APS360 Project Team 34: Heart Event Prediction

**Team Members:** Daivik Dhar, Zijin Zhou, Michael Silver, Bharat Bhargava

## Project Description
This project utilizes machine learning models, specifically LSTM networks or transformer encoders, to predict the likelihood of a patient experiencing a cardiovascular event based on physiological data. The analysis focuses on supervised learning using datasets containing ECG recordings and potentially other vital signs like heart rate and blood pressure.

## Datasets
* **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (ECG only):** [https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/](https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/)
* **MIMIC-III Waveform Database (Heart rate, blood pressure, respiration rate, oxygen saturation):** [https://physionet.org/content/mimicdb/1.0.0/](https://physionet.org/content/mimicdb/1.0.0/)
